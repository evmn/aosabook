                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>We're happy to announce that the fourth AOSA volume "500 Lines or Less" will be
released on Tuesday July 12th, 2016. As usual, the web version will be
accessible for free on <a href="../index.html">aosabook.org</a>, while the PDF and
paperback versions will be available for purchase from Lulu. Within a few
weeks, the paperback will also be available on Amazon. All proceeds from sales
will go to Amnesty International.</p>
<p>Since "500 Lines" is a very code-heavy book, we've decided not to officially
produce an ePub or mobi version of this volume. We still haven't seen good
examples of code-first books being produced in this format, and we feel that
the freely-accessible web format is much more accessible on mobile. Those who
can't live without an ePub can follow our instructions on how to <a href="https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/blob/master/BUILD.md">build the
book from source</a>.</p>
<p>We're extremely grateful for all the support we've received from the hundreds
of people who've reached out to us throughout the production of this book. Your
reviews, issue reports, and direct contributions made this a much better volume
than it would have been otherwise. </p>
<p>The production of 500Lines was greatly accelerated by the financial support of
<a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>. Please join us in <a href="https://twitter.com/pagerduty">thanking
them</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to extend a huge thanks to AOSA general editor <a href="http://www.amyrbrown.ca/">Amy
Brown</a>, who singlehandedly copy-edited all of the
chapters, designed the cover, and rounded out the the thousands of rough edges
that I left behind. If you or your colleagues are ever looking for someone who
knows how to produce books from start to finish, Amy is the person to talk to.</p>
<p>We're looking forward to reading along with you next Tuesday.</p>

                    <p>Today we've <a href="../en/500L/contingent-a-fully-dynamic-build-system.html">published the <em>final chapter</em></a> 
in our <a href="2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/index.html">early access release</a> 
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/brandon_rhodes">Brandon Rhodes</a> 
and <a href="https://twitter.com/drocco007">Daniel Rocco</a>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Brandon and Daniel explore the problem of dependency
management in build systems. Throughout their exploration, we learn about how
to use encapsulation, classes, and design patterns in a programming
language with a strong set of builtin data structures and a rich standard
library -- and, perhaps more importantly, when not to.</p>
<p>We'll write up another post next week about the release process and schedule
for both the print and web versions of 500Lines. Thanks for reading along with
us, and a special thank-you to everyone who opened issues and sent feedback on
these chapters. </p>

release</a>
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by <a href="http://langnostic.inaimathi.ca/">Leo Zovic</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of this early access release, we've already seen a couple of different concurrency models -- a <a href="../en/500L/a-simple-web-server.html">thread-based webserver</a>, and a <a href="../en/500L/a-web-crawler-with-asyncio-coroutines.html">web crawler that uses coroutines</a>. In this chapter, we apply another approach to concurrency by building an <em>event-driven</em> webserver in Common Lisp. We then extend this server into a full-featured web framework by leveraging the power of domain-specific languages.</p>
<p>Next week, we'll be releasing the final chapter in the early-access program. We'll be then doing a test print of the final draft, and the first print version will become available a couple of weeks after that. More on that to follow!</p>

release</a>
for 500 Lines. The chapter was written by Eunsuk Kang, Santiago Perez De Rosso, and Daniel Jackson of the <a href="http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/">Software Design Group</a> at MIT.</p>
<p>This chapter is a bit different from the others in the book. Instead of
building a working program, we are building <em>models</em> of systems that allow us
to explore their behaviors. We do this using a modelling language called
<a href="http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/">Alloy</a>. Along the way, we learn how <em>agile
modelling</em> can help us discover gaps in our designs before or after we've fully
built them out.</p>

<p>In this chapter, Dann walks us through building a <em>graph database</em> from first
principles in JavaScript. Along the way, we pay careful attention to the design
decisions we are making, and have several opportunities to assess the kinds of
predictions and tradeoffs that practicing programmers face in their work every
day. The end result is a database with surprisingly powerful query capabilities
that runs in your browser.</p>

features. In the process, we learn a few lessons about writing software that is
resilient to change. </p>

<p>Most programmers feel a certain sense of wonder the first few times they write
a working program. However, there is a special sense of wonder that comes from
writing a program that can actually <em>learn</em> behaviours that the programmer has
not explicitly specified.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Marina shows us how to write a program that recognizes
handwritten characters by using the machine-learning technique of training a
<em>neural network</em> to do the job for us. </p>

runtime depending on the scenario. </p>
<p>In this chapter, Christian shows us how this pattern can be useful when trying
to solve the <em>flow shop scheduling</em> problem, which is a notoriously difficult
problem in computer science and operations research. More generally, we learn
how to use this pattern in our own practice when faced with intractable
problems.</p>

<p>Visual programming languages are popular in early computer science education because, as Dethe notes in his chapter, "a well-done block language can eliminate syntax errors completely." </p>
<p>In this week's early-access release, we create our own visual programming language in JavaScript from first principles. Along the way, we think twice about the wisdom of following conventional software organization principles like MVC (model-view-controller) without first analyzing the nature of our problem.</p>

<p>In this chapter, Jess teaches us about <em>sampling</em>, a generally applicable technique for complex problems in which it is difficult to find an exact solution. She uses an interesting motivating example -- generating magical items in a game -- to explain how this works. Along the way, we also learn how to write code that works at the limits of floating point precision.</p>

<p>In this chapter, Malini shows us how to design a fault-tolerant, scalable continuous integration system by splitting into multiple components that each have a specialized role. We've seen this a more academic example of this once before in the <a href="2015/09/early-access-release-of-dustin-j-mitchells-clustering-by-consensus-chapter/index.html">cluster chapter</a>; in this one, we get to see a more practical implementation of a distributed system that solves a real-life problem. </p>

<p>Programmers often encounter some sort of persistent data store very early in
our careers. There is nothing quite as opaque and mysterious as a full-featured
database system, regardless of the underlying paradigm used for data
organization.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Yoav shows how using immutability as a guiding principle
allows us to build an astonishingly capable database system in fewer than 500
lines of Clojure. This includes a transaction system, a miniature declarative
query language, and a host of other features. </p>

<p>Donald Knuth once said that the best theory is motivated by practice, and the best practice by theory. In this chapter, Dustin does something that many programmers have do at least once in their career; he implements a rather opaque algorithm from primary sources (PAXOS) that solves a very practical problem (distributed consensus.) He then demonstrates how sound engineering practices allow us to implement something that at first seems slightly beyond our capability, and to convince ourselves that it actually works. </p>

<p>Many programmers treat their programming language implementations as black
boxes. Static analysis tools or language analysis tools can seem
indistinguishable from magic, and good treatments of these topics have been
buried deep in academic curricula that few of us make time for.</p>
<p>In our opinion, Leah has done a terrific job of demystifying the nature of the
techniques used in static analysis and introspection in her chapter. While her
work is specific to <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a>, the lessons learned are
applicable in other languages. Enjoy!</p>

                    <p>Today we've <a href="../en/500L/a-web-crawler-with-asyncio-coroutines.html">published the third
chapter</a>
in our <a href="2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/index.html">early access

van Rossum</a>.</p>
<p>We hope that this chapter provides Python programmers with a deep introduction
to how coroutines work, and why and when we should use them. Coroutines first
became a hot topic in Python with the release of the asyncio framework; now, in
Python 3.5, they are also built directly into the language itself. </p>
<p>Beyond Python, there has been a longstanding tension between
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/threads.pdf">thread-based</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/papers/threads-hotos-2003.pdf">event-based</a>
systems in computer science. It can be helpful to a practising programmer to
understand the nuances in this debate, as anyone building things atop
frameworks that use these constructs will eventually have to understand them.</p>
<p>We will have chapters on building thread-based and event-based systems in "500
Lines or Less", and we think that this chapter will serve as an interesting
contrast to both of these contributions in the final draft of the book.</p>

                    <p>Today we've <a href="../en/500L/web-spreadsheet.html">published the second
chapter</a> in our <a href="2015/09/500-lines-or-less-early-access-web-release/index.html">early access
release</a>
for 500 Lines. <a href="https://twitter.com/audreyt">Audrey Tang</a> has contributed
chapters to
<a href="../en/posa/from-socialcalc-to-ethercalc.html">two</a>
<a href="../en/socialcalc.html">previous</a> volumes of AOSA, and we're
very happy to have her back for <a href="https://github.com/aosabook/500lines">"500 Lines or
Less."</a></p>
<p>When Audrey's chapter was first presented to readers, many protested at how
dependent it was on external frameworks and libraries. This is only half of the
truth; Instead of just leveraging these components, Audrey provides a miniature
ontology for the kinds of patterns that web programmers can expect to use now
and in the future. (For the curious, there is also a <a href="https://github.com/audreyt/500lines/tree/master/spreadsheet/as-without-angularjs">99-line version that uses
only DOM
APIs</a>.)</p>
<p>Most engineers spend a lot of time figuring out how to build software based on
the work of others. We feel that reading about how an experienced engineer
identifies the patterns in software she is reusing is a valuable lesson for us
all.</p>
<p>This chapter was written <em>way back</em> in 2014 when Traceur was the leading ES6
compiler implementation. Audrey has informed us that she probably would have
used <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> if she was writing this chapter now. If
you are interested in updating the source and the chapter to reflect this,
we're open to pull requests!</p>
<p>If you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
<a href="https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues">GitHub tracker</a>. </p>
<p>Audrey also helpfully translated her chapter into Traditional Chinese; you can
find the source for this version
<a href="https://github.com/audreyt/500lines/blob/master/spreadsheet/chapter.zh-tw.md">here</a>. </p>

                    <p>It has been a long time coming, but I'm happy to announce that the first
artifact from 500 Lines or Less will be published on aosabook.org today.</p>
<p>Writing a chapter for 500 Lines is a rigorous process. The code for
each chapter is first reviewed by technical reviewers; then, the chapter drafts
are reviewed by different readers for content and accessibility. Finally, our
heroic copy editor Amy Brown examines each line of text for grammatical errors
or tricky phrasings. And yet, we're sure there are still bugs in this book
waiting to be found.</p>
<p>Just as it is very expensive to fix a bug once it hits production, it is
similarly painful to find an error in a book once it has already gone to print.
To this end, we're going to be doing an early-access release of each chapter on
the 500Lines website at the rate of one per week for the next 20 weeks. We hope
that getting these chapters out early will give all of you the chance to find
the snags that we missed throughout this process. We expect to go to print very
shortly after this process winds down. </p>
<p>These early-access chapters will only be published from this blog, and will be
linked from the news section on
<a href="../en/index.html">aosabook.org</a> and announced on Twitter from
<a href="https://twitter.com/aosabook">@aosabook</a>. The production version of the
website will be published around the same time as the final draft goes to
print.</p>
<p>With all of that out of the way, I'm happy to share <a href="https://twitter.com/nedbat">Ned Batchelder's</a>
<a href="../en/500L/a-template-engine.html">template engine chapter</a>
with you. Ned's chapter is a great example of what we were hoping to
accomplish with 500Lines: it is compact, well-explained, and there are several
discussions of interesting decisions and trade-offs he had to make while writing
it. </p>
<p>If you find errors you think are worth reporting, please open an issue on our
<a href="https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/issues">GitHub tracker</a>. We'll try our
best to collate issues sent to us on Twitter and via other channels, but we
have a lot of book to work on still, and we're probably going to miss things
unless they're persisted in that tracker somehow.</p>
<p>Many thanks again to
<a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/company/work-with-us/">PagerDuty</a> for their generous
sponsorship of this project.  Please give them a
<a href="https://twitter.com/pagerduty">public thank-you or two</a> throughout this

                    <p>While the <a href="../index.html">Performance of Open Source Applications</a> was
released just a few months ago, work on the fourth AOSA book is already well
underway!</p>
<p>This volume is called <em>500 Lines or Less</em>, and is focused on short but complete
implementations of canonical programs and architectural patterns in computer
science. </p>
<p>The motivation is described succinctly in the project statement: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every architect studies family homes, apartments, schools, and other common
types of buildings during her training. Equally, every programmer ought to
know how a compiler turns text into instructions, how a spreadsheet updates
cells, and how a browser decides what to put where when it renders a page.
This book's goal is to give readers that broad-ranging overview, and while
doing so, to help them understand how software designers think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each chapter will consist of a (max) 500 line, self-contained program, and a
narrative surrounding that program that describes how it works, and (more
importantly) <em>why</em> it is designed the way it is. </p>
<p>Contributors <a href="https://github.com/aosabook/500lines">are already working</a> on
their 500 line implementations. Once each contributor completes a "first draft"
of their code, we assign them a technical reviewers to provide constructive
commentary.</p>
<p><strong>That's where we need your help.</strong></p>
<p>There are a <em>lot</em> of contributors to this project, and we want them to get as
much feedback as possible before they begin writing up their chapters!</p>
<p>We're looking for reviewers at all levels of experience. If you're still early in
your programming career, we'd especially love to hear from you, as your
opinions as to which parts are easily accessible and which are confusing will
be incredibly helpful.</p>
<p>In terms of scheduling, our first-draft code submissions are due by end of February, but
many contributors are ahead of schedule and could use reviewers right now!</p>
<p>We're also hoping that our code reviewers will stick around to provide
commentary on the drafts of completed chapters once those start to roll in from
March onwards.</p>
<p>All technical reviewers will of course receive credit for their work in the
book, and will be supporting a good cause -- all royalties from paid-for
versions of the book will go to Amnesty International.</p>

                    <p>One of the reasons we started this project is that almost every other
book on software architecture doesn't actually show readers the
architectures of any actual systems. In particular, most university
students can get through a four-year degree without ever seeing how
large applications are put together. We're therefore very excited to
learn that Dr. Neil Ernst is using AOSA in an undergrad course he's
teaching at the University of British Columbia. If you'd like to see
what his students think of the systems we've described, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak3hetL00EgKdFBlWHBia0VBcE9jd3I5bDE5eGhtMnc#gid=0">their
presentations are online</a>. And if you know of anyone else doing this,
please send us a pointer.</p>

                    <p>Well, it's been a busy two months since Tavish or I have posted anything
on here. Things have been progressing nicely though! We've got 21
authors lined up, and have already gone through 13 proposed outlines.
I'm extremely excited with the proposed chapters so far! We've got a
great mixture of low-level nitty-gritty projects and higher level
applications.</p>
<p>Here's a few more examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ilya Grigorik is going to be discussing the insane number of hoops
    that the Chrome team has jumped through to improve Chrome's network
    performance</li>
<li>Clint Talbert and Joel Maher are going to be recounting the journey
    of improving Talos, the performance testing framework at Mozilla.</li>
<li>Michael Snoyman and Kazu Yamamoto are writing about Warp, their
    high-performance Haskell-based HTTP engine.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The first drafts of the chapters will (hopefully) start rolling in, and
we should have a preliminary table of contents ready to go in the next
month or so.</p>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who has responded! Reading through your
outlines, I'm super excited about the book and the fantastic material
that's going into it!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Tony</p>

                    <p>Dear GitHub,</p>
<p>You provide a wonderful workspace where millions of people can share
what they make, but there's something you could do to make yourself even
better. Could you please provide a way for us to create plug
applications directly into your site the way Facebook does? Thousands of
really cool software tools are just waiting to be discovered, from code
analyzers to project history visualizers, and while your APIs already
let them use your data on their own web sites, people would be much more
likely to find them and use them if they were nested directly in
projects' GitHub pages. It wouldn't be much of a technological
challenge—given the way Facebook's stock has been doing, you could
probably even persuade one or two of their engineers to come and help
build it—and it would kickstart the same healthy explosion of
third-party tools we saw when Eclipse first came on the scene.</p>
<p>Thanks very much,</p>
<p>Us.</p>
<p>p.s. If you like this idea, please tweet the following:</p>

                    <p>A few weeks ago Greg <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/blog/2012/06/the-performance-of-open-source-applications/">posted</a> about the next book we're doing: <em>The
Performance of Open Source Applications</em>. Well, we don't have a book
yet, but we've made some progress. Earlier this week we had our 15th
"yes" from an author, which puts us close to the chapter counts of
<a href="../index.html">AOSA</a>. We're excited about that and we hope you are too. Here are a
couple of the chapters we're planning:</p>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Jessica McKellar on Twisted <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/twisted.html">again</a>, getting into the details of
    asynchronous I/O.</li>
<li>Audrey Tang on profiling and optimizing <a href="http://www.ethercalc.org/">Ethercalc</a>, a Google
    Docs-esque spreadsheet application written in node.js.</li>
<li>Kyle Huey on Mozilla's <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/MemShrink">Memshrink</a> project, which aims to make
    Firefox faster and "slimmer".</li>
<li>Rosangela Canino-Koning and Eric McDonald on processing terabytes of
    data in the <a href="https://github.com/brigranger/Kmer">Khmer project</a>, which is a "library and toolkit for
    doing k-mer-based dataset analysis and transformations".</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Remember, if you want to see your favourite Open Source Application
discussed in the new book, we're accepting contributions. If you're
interested, please get in touch at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#112;&#111;&#115;&#97;&#98;&#111;&#111;&#107;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#112;&#111;&#115;&#97;&#98;&#111;&#111;&#107;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.

                    <p>We are pleased to announce that we are starting work on a third book in
this series, which will be titled <em>The Performance of Open Source
Applications</em>. Each chapter will discuss a performance issue in a real
open source system—it could be an over-the-shoulder view of how a
performance problem was fixed, a discussion of how design decisions
affected performance in a particular application, or something else
along those lines. Each entry will be 12-15 pages long, and we hope to
have first drafts by the end of October so that we can publish the book
in Spring 2013. As with AOSA, royalties will go to Amnesty International
and the book will be available for free online under a Creative Commons
license. If you are interested in participating, please contact us at

<p>Why performance rather than architecture? Because it's something that
every programmer has to deal with eventually, but which is usually left
out of their education. The last general book on making programs fast
that we know of was Jon Louis Bentley's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Efficient-Programs-Prentice-Hall-Software/dp/0139702512/">Writing Efficient
Programs</a></em>, which was published thirty years ago. There have been lots
of more specialized books since (we're particularly fond of Steve
Souders' <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Web-Sites-Essential/dp/0596529309/">High Performance Web Sites</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Even-Faster-Web-Sites-Performance/dp/0596522304/">Even Faster Web
Sites</a></em>, and of John Lakos's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Software-Design-John-Lakos/dp/0201633620/">Large-Scale C++ Software Design</a></em>),
but we think the time is right for something that touches on everything
from squeezing the last few cycles out of every precious milliwat in an
embedded sensor to maximizing throughput of large-scale e-commerce
applications. We hope you'll think so too, and we look forward to
hearing from you.</p>

                    <p>Amy Brown, our indefatigable editor, has posted a series of articles on
her blog about what's involved in going from LaTeX to a published book
on Lulu. We think this is a great alternative to traditional (read:
expensive and restricted) academic publishing, and would welcome other
tips and tricks.</p>
