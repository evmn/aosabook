        <div class="entry-content">
        <p>We're happy to announce that the fourth AOSA volume "500 Lines or Less" will be
released on Tuesday July 12th, 2016. As usual, the web version will be
accessible for free on <a href="../../../../index.html">aosabook.org</a>, while the PDF and
paperback versions will be available for purchase from Lulu. Within a few
weeks, the paperback will also be available on Amazon. All proceeds from sales
will go to Amnesty International.</p>
<p>Since "500 Lines" is a very code-heavy book, we've decided not to officially
produce an ePub or mobi version of this volume. We still haven't seen good
examples of code-first books being produced in this format, and we feel that
the freely-accessible web format is much more accessible on mobile. Those who
can't live without an ePub can follow our instructions on how to <a href="https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/blob/master/BUILD.md">build the
book from source</a>.</p>
<p>We're extremely grateful for all the support we've received from the hundreds
of people who've reached out to us throughout the production of this book. Your
reviews, issue reports, and direct contributions made this a much better volume
than it would have been otherwise. </p>
<p>The production of 500Lines was greatly accelerated by the financial support of
<a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>. Please join us in <a href="https://twitter.com/pagerduty">thanking
them</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to extend a huge thanks to AOSA general editor <a href="http://www.amyrbrown.ca/">Amy
Brown</a>, who singlehandedly copy-edited all of the
chapters, designed the cover, and rounded out the the thousands of rough edges
that I left behind. If you or your colleagues are ever looking for someone who
knows how to produce books from start to finish, Amy is the person to talk to.</p>
<p>We're looking forward to reading along with you next Tuesday.</p>
