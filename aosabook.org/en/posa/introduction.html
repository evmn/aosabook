          <p>It’s commonplace to say that computer hardware is now so fast that most
developers don’t have to worry about performance. In fact, Douglas
Crockford declined to write a chapter for this book for that&nbsp;reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were to write a chapter, it would be about anti-performance: most
effort spent in pursuit of performance is wasted. I don’t think that
is what you are looking&nbsp;for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Donald Knuth made the same point thirty years&nbsp;ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time:
premature optimization is the root of all&nbsp;evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but between mobile devices with limited power and memory, and data
analysis projects that need to process terabytes, a growing number of
developers <em>do</em> need to make their code faster, their data structures
smaller, and their response times shorter. However, while hundreds of
textbooks explain the basics of operating systems, networks, computer
graphics, and databases, few (if any) explain how to find and fix things
in real applications that are simply too damn&nbsp;slow.</p>
<p>This collection of case studies is our attempt to fill that gap. Each
chapter is written by real developers who have had to make an existing
system faster or who had to design something to be fast in the first
place. They cover many different kinds of software and performance
goals; what they have in common is a detailed understanding of what
actually happens when, and how the different parts of large applications
fit together. Our hope is that this book will—like its predecessor <em>The
Architecture of Open Source Applications</em>—help you become a better
developer by letting you look over these experts’&nbsp;shoulders.</p>
